2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Enter the project directory:

> cd simple-basic-chatbot

3. **Run the Chatbot**: Run the Python script to start the chatbot:

The chatbot responds to various user inputs with predefined answers stored in a dictionary. Here are some example interactions:

> User: Hi
> Chatbot: Hey

> User: How are you?
> Chatbot: As a bot, I don't have feelings or emotions, but I'm here and ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you have! How can I help you today?

> User: Do you know a joke?
> Chatbot: Of course, here's one for you: Why did the data scientist break up with their significant other? Because they couldn't find a meaningful correlation between them!
